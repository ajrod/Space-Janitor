Space-Janitor
=============

(Java Applet) Space Janitor is a game I created at a game jam in a couple of hours.  
It is a Clone of the Retro Asteroid game but with an open world and some interesting physics. The game
is very much incomplete but some day (maybe never?) when I have spare time I plan on adding to it. 

The code is well documented and was built using NetBeans so included is a NetBeans project (although Eclipse
could just as easily  be used). Space Janitor was built quite a while ago, back when I was not as familiar with 
Java as I am now. Creating this game served as a greate exercise in Java and Objected Oriented Programming in general.

Controls
-------
Move with the arrow keys and shoot with the spacebar. Your goal is to help clean up space by destroying
space junk, ateroids and planets all while avoiding contact with out of control space junk.

Each level tells you how much mass needs to be cleaned from Space in order for you to complete
the mission. Good Luck!
